# Mendelian Randomization

---

Mendelian Randomization (MR) is the process that refers to the random segregation and assortment of genes from ancestors to offspring that takes place during gamete formation and gives a method of using genetic variants to make casual inferences regarding the relationship between exposure and outcomes. The basic principle utilized in the MR pipeline, is that if a genetic variant either alters the level of or mimics the biological effects of a exposure that itself alters disease risk, then these genetic variants should be related to disease risk.The goal of MR studies is to provide evidence for or against a causal relationship between a exposure and a disease. Genetic variants are used because these are less susceptible for confounding because of it is subjected to Mendel’s first law, the law of of segregation. These genetic variants segregate independently and randomly from environmental factors, and it can be assumed that genetic variants segregate independently from other traits.

This package provides functionality for the following operations:

  * Calculate the standard deviation from the effectsize or log odd score when it is not present. `mr.calculate.se()`
  
  * Clumping, for pruning SNPs that are in linkage disequilibrium (LD). ALso is provided a method for finding proxy SNPs for replacing SNPs that are in LD. `mr.clump()`
  
  * Cochran's Q test, for determining SNPs that overfit the model, or the ones that introduce pleiotropic effects. `mr.cochran.Q.test()`
  
  * Mendelian Randomization Egger method (MR-egger method) for estimating causality, testing causality, and for testing the overall pleiotropy within the data set. `mr.egger.method()`
  
  * When your data set misses allelic information, this can be queried by using a reference file. `mr.find.missing.allelic.information()`
  
  * Forest plotting the MR analysis, for seeing the overall weight a SNP brings into the study. `mr.forest.plot()`
  
  * Funnel plotting the methods used with the MR analysis to detect study bias. `mr.funnel.plot()`
  
  * Get the chromosome number and position of SNPs. `mr.get.chr.pos()`
  
  * Harmonization of the data set. Align SNPs, remove problematic SNPs, for example palindromic SNPs, mismatch SNPs, and SNPs that have a wrong reference. `mr.harmonize()`
  
  * Inverse-Variance Weighted method for averaging the estimate ratios. `mr.inverse.variance.weighted.method()`
  
  * A highly fasionable way of plotting MR results. `mr.plot()`
  
  * The functionality to pre-process data, which test the data set on missing alleles, missing beta's, selects for genome-wide significance, removes duplicates,  and removes alleles from which it is not possible to measure direction. `mr.pre.process()`
  
  * qq-plot for the p-value distribution of a chosen method. `mr.qq.p.distribution()`
  
  * A normal qq-plot for plotting the theoretical quantiles against the normal quantiles. `mr.qq.plot()`
  
  * Remove a certain region within a chromosome. `mr.remove.region()`
  
  * Perform wald-ratio for obtaining a causal estimate based on the exposure regression on genotype and the outcome regression of genotype. `mr.wald.ratio()`

# Installing Mendelian Randomization

---

The package is hosted on bitbucket, and this allows for a smooth installation, and updates are easy to install. Before installing Mendelian Randomization, make sure you have installed `devtools`:

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
```

And then you are ready to install the `mendelianRandomization` package:

```{r}
devtools::install_bitbucket("matthijsknigge/mendelianRandomization")
```

# Tutorial

---

The package also contains test data for doing a basic Mendelian Randomization analysis. The first step is to read the data. For this analysis we want to infer causality between an exposure and outcome. In this setup the exposure is Celiac Disease, and the outcome is High-density-lipoproteïne (HDL).

```{r}
# the exposure
exposure <- data("celiac")

# the outcome
outcome  <- data("hdl")
```

Lets check out the data.
```{r}
head(exposure)
```
Here we se a column with SNP identifiers, the effect allele, the effectsize, the pvalue, and the standard deviation.

|SNPs       | effect_allele | Z_OR       | P       | se          |

```

Here we see the idenfication for the position in a chromosome for a SNP, the SNP identifiers, the effect allele (A1), the other allele (A2), the effectsize, the standard error, population size, the p value, and the frequence of the effect allele over the other allele.

We need both files at least to contain the SNP id, beta, se, pval, effect allele and the other allele. Since the other allele is missing for the exposure, we have to query it. The alles are queried with `mr.find.missing.alleles`.

```{r}
celiac <- mr.find.missing.allelic.information(data = celiac, 
                                              thousand.G = "path/to/reference.bim")
head(celiac)
```
|SNPs       | effect_allele | Z_OR       | P       | se          | other_allele |

|rs11260562 | A             | -0.03936472|3.344e-01| 0.04078024  |C|

Now that we have what we need, we can start pre-processing the data. But first let's check out how many SNPs we have for exposure and outcome.

```{r}
# exposure amount of SNPs
length(exposure$SNP)
> 91864

# outcome amount of SNPs
length(outcome$rsid)
> 242276
```
The next step is to pre-process the exposure, and only the exposure because we are interested in the effect of the exposure on the outcome. We select for genome-wide significance, thus the p-value of the exposure must > 5*10^-8. Also the SNPs without effectsize will be removed, the SNPs from which it is impossible to measure the strand will be removed, and the duplicates will be removed. Besides this, also all negative effectsizes are flipped, and their alleles are also flipped. This is done because we want to measure the positive effect of the exposure on the outcome. This is done with `mr.pre.process`.

```{r}
celiac <- mr.pre.process(B = celiac$Z_OR, B.se = celiac$se, 
                         pval = celiac$P, effect_allele = celiac$effect_allele, 
                         other_allele = celiac$other_allele, SNP = celiac$SNP)

# amount of SNP left
length(celiac$SNP)
> 1753

head(celiac)

```
|  SNP    |      beta  |se        |  effect_allele | other_allele |     pval     |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------|----------------------------------------

|rs10165460| 0.1773090| 0.02143430 |    C | T |1.315e-16|


Now it is time to combine exposure and outcome, the next step is to harmonize both datasets. This includes aligning SNPs, and taking the intercept. Herefore we use `mr.harmonize`.

```{r}
h <- mr.harmonize(By = hdl$Beta, Bx = celiac$beta, By.se = hdl$SE, Bx.se = celiac$se, 
                  outcome.pval = hdl$P.value, exposure.pval = celiac$pval, 
                  outcome.effect_allele = hdl$A1, exposure.effect_allele = celiac$effect_allele, 
                  exposure.other_allele = celiac$other_allele, outcome.SNP = hdl$rsid, 
                  exposure.SNP = celiac$SNP)
# how many SNPs after harmonization?
length(h$SNP)
> 252

head(h)
```
|        SNP|         By|        Bx|    By.se|      Bx.se|          pval| effect_allele| other_allele|

We do not want our data set to suffer from pleiotropic effects which can be reintroduced by linkage disequilibrium. So we will clump our data set, and the SNPs that are in LD with each other will be removed and will be replaced by a suitable proxy. The clump methods has various other parameters that can be used, but here we use the default, this is done with `mr.clump`. Within the table itself nothing changes, it is the same as the previous table shown

```{r}
h <- mr.clump(data = h, refdat = "path/to/reference", verbose = T)

# Amount of SNPs left?
length(h$SNP)
> 53

head(h)
```

Now it is time to estimate the causalty bewteen regression of the outcome on the genotype and the regression from the exposure on the genotype. Here we use the `mr.wald.method` to calculate the causal estimate between genetic variants. This method return the causal estimate, the standard error of the causal estimate, and the p-value.

```{r}
wald    <- mr.wald.ratio(By = h$By, Bx = h$Bx, By.se = h$By.se, Bx.se = h$Bx.se)
h$iv    <- wald$iv
h$iv.se <- wald$iv.se
h$iv.p  <- wald$iv.p

head(h)

```
This results in the newly added columns: iv: the estimate, iv.se: the standard error of the causal estime, iv.p the test of the causal estimate.

Now with multiple genetic variants, their ratio estimates from the Two-sample MR can be averaged by using an Inverse Variance Weighted method to provide an overall causal estimate. This method assumes that the ratio estimates are all uncorrelated, that there is no pleiotropy. This method can be deployed with `mr.inverse.variance.weighted.method`, and will return the ivw estimate, the standard error of the estimate, and a test of the method. And also the MR-egger can be performed with a modification to the weighted linear regression from the Inverse-Variance Weighted method. Instead of setting the intercept parameter to zero, the term is estimated as part of the analysis. To see if the estimate is significant one could the test the slope and see if it is significant different than zero, this is the test for causal effect. And the intercept from the regression can be interpreted as an average pleiotropic effect. If the average pleiotropic effect is zero, then the IVW gives an constant estimate of the causal effect. But, if this is not zero, than the average pleiotropic effects differ from zero and there is pleiotropy, and than the IVW estimate is biased. This method is performed with `mr.egger.method`, and return a causal estimate, the standard error of the estimate, a test for pleiotropy, and a test for the causal estimate.

```{r}
# inverse-variance weighted method
inverse.variance.weighted <- mr.inverse.variance.weighted.method(By = h$By, Bx = h$Bx, By.se = h$By.se, Bx.se = h$Bx.se)
inverse.variance.weighted

```

After this, the Cochran's Q test can be applied. Which is a method that is used to find SNPs which have an effect that is to great and can bias the estimates, and or removes possible pleiotropic causing SNPs. This is an iterative method that calculates the Q term for each SNP, calculates an overal Q term. Than this overal term is tested, and if this test does not exceeds a given threshold it removes the max Q term and restarts the iteration until this threshold is met. This function returns a vector with 1 or 0 indicating the SNPs should be used in re-calculating the estimates from IVW and MR-egger. This method is called by `mr.cochrans.Q.test`.

```
# apply cochran's Q test
h$cochran.Q <- mr.cochran.Q.test(data = h, pval = .05)$cochran.Q

# the data has been order decreasing to show that on SNP is removed
head(h[order(h$cochran.Q),])

After the Cochran's Q test is applied, the estimates can be recalculated.

```
# inverse-variance weighted after Cochran's Q test
inverse.variance.weighted.Q <- mr.inverse.variance.weighted.method(By = h[which(h$cochran.Q == 1),]$By, Bx = h[which(h$cochran.Q == 1),]$Bx, 
                                                                   By.se = h[which(h$cochran.Q == 1),]$By.se, Bx.se = h[which(h$cochran.Q == 1),]$Bx.se)

Now it is time for plotting the results. This is done with `mr.plot`.

```
p <- mr.plot(By = h$By, Bx = h$Bx, By.se = h$By.se, Bx.se = h$Bx.se, iv = h$iv, iv.se = h$iv.se, ivw = inverse.variance.weighted$ivw,
             egger = egger$egger, egger.i = egger$egger.i, chochran.Q = h$cochran.Q, ivw.Q = inverse.variance.weighted.Q$ivw, egger.Q = egger.Q$egger,
             egger.i.Q = egger.Q$egger.i, egger.p.fdr = egger$egger.p, ivw.p.fdr = inverse.variance.weighted$ivw.p, egger.i.p = egger$egger.i.p,
             outcome.name = "High-density-lipoproteïne (HDL)", exposure.name = "Celiac")
ggdraw(p)
```
